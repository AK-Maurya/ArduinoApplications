# Arduino Applications
This Repository contains the code for different application made using Arduino UNO. 
The objective here is to develop the arduino applications mostly in C/C++ with minimum support from other libraries. 
The applications involve direct manipulations of microcontroller pins, here our microcontroller is atmega328p
